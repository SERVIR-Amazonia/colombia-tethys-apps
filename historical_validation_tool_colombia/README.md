# HISTORICAL VALIDATION TOOL COLOMBIA

Tethys app class for Historical Validation Tool Colombia.

## Description

The "Historical Validation Tool" is a web application developed on platforms based on Tethys Platform. Its main objective is to enable the visualization of forecasts and the assessment of exceeding a specific return period using the GEOGloWS StreamFlows model and the Bias Correction methodology.

It is important to highlight that this tool is used to validate and compare the model results with real historical data. This provides a more accurate evaluation of the model's capability to predict extreme hydrological events and helps improve the reliability of the forecasts.

Furthermore, the Bias Correction methodology used in the tool allows for the correction of potential biases in the model results, further enhancing the accuracy of hydrological predictions.
