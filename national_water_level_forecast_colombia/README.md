# NATIONAL WATER LEVEL FORECAST TOOL COLOMBIA

Tethys app class for National Water Level Forecast Colombia.

## Description

The National Water Level Forecast Tool aims to perform a comparison between the observed river levels at IDEAM stations in Colombia and the levels estimated using the bias correction methodology applied to the forecasts generated by the GEOGloWS Streamflows tool.

The main purpose of this tool is to provide an accurate and reliable assessment of river levels, allowing for the identification of possible discrepancies between the observed and forecasted levels. The bias correction methodology is applied to improve the accuracy of the forecasts by adjusting the estimated data to closely match the actual observed levels.

By comparing the observed levels with the corrected estimated levels, patterns, trends, or significant discrepancies can be identified. This can be highly useful for decision-making in water resource management, emergency planning, and prevention of hydrological-related natural disasters.
